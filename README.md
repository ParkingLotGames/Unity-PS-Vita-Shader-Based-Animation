## About
chenjd's [Render-Crowd-Of-Animated-Characters](https://github.com/chenjd/Render-Crowd-Of-Animated-Characters) modified to work on PS Vita.
Using the Vertex Shader to render large crowds of animated characters. An animation texture is used in the vertex shader to modify the vertex position of the mesh at runtime.
